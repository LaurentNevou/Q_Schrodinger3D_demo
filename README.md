# Schroedinger3D_demo

This code solves the time independent Schroedinger equation in 3D with a constant mass.

It uses 2 different algorithms that can be switched ON/OFF:

-> The FEM: Finite Elements Method (you have to be gentle with the amount of meshing points)

-> The PWE: Plane Wave Expansion method that sloves the equation in the Fourier space

Different potentials are proposed:

-> InAs/GaAs quantum dot (lens)

-> InAs/AlInAs quantum dash

-> GaN/AlN quantum dot (pyramidal with hexagon base) STILL HAS TO BE DONE...

Any potential can be loaded with homogeneous grid x,y,z [m] and V [eV]
